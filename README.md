These steps assume that one already knows Python,Django,Sqlite,HTML,CSS and JS. And that the necessary IDE along with extensions for the said IDE are already installed.

Im using VSCode as IDE. The steps may vary depending on the IDE used.

Steps to start the project:
1. Install virtualenv
    For this open project and open terminal. Type pip install virtualenv if not already installed.
2. Activate the vitrual environment
    for this do the following steps
    2.1 cd env
    2.2 cd Scripts
    2.3 .\activate

steps 2.1 through 2.3 have to be performed always when relaunching the project.
